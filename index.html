        <section class="information">
          <p>
            <a href="">The Koenigsegg Agera</a> is a mid-engine sports car produced by
            Swedish car manufacturer Koenigsegg. It is a successor to the
            CCX/CCXR. The name comes from the Swedish verb 'agera' which means
            "to act" or in imperative form "(You) act!".
          </p>
          <p>
            It was named Hypercar of the Year in 2010 by <a href="#">Top Gear magazine.</a>
            <b>The Agera RS variant</b> became the world's fastest production car in
            2017, setting a record with a GPS-verified two-way average top
            speed of 447 km/h (278 mph) and a fastest straight-line speed of <b>
              458 km/h (285 mph).</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Agera ceased production in July 2018 with the unveiling of the
            two final edition cars at the 2018 Goodwood Festival of Speed. It
            was succeeded by the Jesko in 2019.

          <h4>Engine and transmission</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="description">
              <p>In early development, the car was fitted with a <b>4.7-litre V8 engine</b> with <a href="">fixed-vane
                  twin-turbochargers</a>, but the engine was replaced with an in-house developed <b>5.0-litre V8
                  engine</b> and
                fitted with twin-turbochargers which generates a maximum power output of <b>706 kW (960 PS; 947 hp) at
                  6,900 rpm</b> and <b>1,100 N⋅m (811 lbf⋅ft)</b> of <b>torque at 4,000 rpm.</b> The total weight of the
                engine is
                only
                <b>197 kg (434 lb)</b> due to a carbon fibre inlet manifold and aluminium construction. The transmission
                is a
                specially developed <b>CIMA 7-speed dual-clutch</b> with <a href="">paddle shifters</a>. It is the first
                dual-clutch
                transmission to feature only one input shaft. The second clutch slows down the input shaft during up
                shifts in order to reduce the time it takes to synchronise the next gear, resulting in faster shift
                times. Most notably, the transmission weighs only <b>81 kg (179 lb).</b>

          <p>The Agerahas a body made from impregnated <b>carbon fibre/kevlar</b> with lightweight reinforcements.
            <b>The
              car's
              hardtop roof is stowable under the front hood lid.</b> The chassis is also made out of carbon fibre with
            an
            aluminium honeycomb structure that comes with integrated fuel tanks for optimal weight distribution and
            safety. The rear wing is electronically adjustable with auto setting or manual control in order to have as
            little compromise as possible between low drag and downforce, depending on driving conditions. The
            Agera comes with forged aluminum wheels with <b>centre locking nuts</b>,<b>measuring 19-inch</b> on the
            front and
            <b>20-inch on the rear and wrapped</b> in a set of <b>Michelin Super Sport tyres</b> that can be used for
            speeds of up
            to 420 km/h (260 mph). Other notable features include the trademark <a
              href="">"dihedral-synchro-helix-actuation"</a>
            doors, a new traction control system, LED lighting, blue hood stripes that continue through the cockpit of
            the car and a custom interior with a new "Ghost light" lighting system, which uses carbon nanotubes in a
            unique configuration to shine through the car's aluminium buttons.

              <figcaption>Koenigsegg Agera N</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p><b>The Agera R</b> made its debut at the <b>March 2011</b> Geneva Motor Show with a <a href="">Speed Racer
              livery</a>, and <a href="">special
              Michelin tyres</a>. It can accelerate from <b>0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.8 seconds</b> and attain a
            theoretical
            top
            speed of <b>439 km/h (273 mph)</b>. The Agera R has a drag coefficient of Cd=0.37, or Cd=0.33 at high speed
            due to
            its adaptive rear wing, while producing <b>300 kg (660 lb)</b> of downforce at <b>250 km/h (155 mph)</b>.
            This adaptive
            rear wing system is lighter than conventional hydraulic/electrical adaptive systems, and has the unique
            ability to compensate for head/tailwind due to its spring-loaded design. Furthermore, the pylons holding the
            wing play not only a role in the Agera R's aerodynamic performance, but also assist in extracting hot air
            from the engine bay.</p>
          <p>On <b>2 September 2011</b>, during test sessions in <a href="">Ängelholm</a>, the Agera R broke six world
            land speed records for
            a production car, including <b>0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 14.53 seconds</b>, and <b>0–300–0 km/h in only
              21.19
              seconds</b>. The braking performance required to maintain this record is enabled in part by the Agera's
            stability, demonstrated by Koenigsegg test driver and drivetrain technician Robert Serwanski, who was
            recorded by passenger Rob Ferretti (founder of the group "Super Speeders") braking from 300 km/h to 0
            without holding the steering wheel.</p>
          <p>The Agera R can produce lateral cornering forces of 1.60 G, due to a combination of mechanical balance
            and high levels of grip from the specially developed Michelin Supersport tyres.</p>
          <p>The 2013 version of the Agera R premiered at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. Upgrades included carbon fibre
            wheels, enhanced aerodynamics, and engine upgrades allowing the Agera R's twin-turbo V8 engine to have a
            power output of <b>1,140 PS (1,124 hp; 838 kW)</b> at <b>7,100 rpm and 1,200 N⋅m (885 lb⋅ft)</b> of
            <b>torque at 4,100 rpm</b> on
            E85 biofuel. Koenigsegg's Flex Fuel Sensor technology allows the ECU to respond to varying fuel
            qualities and alcohol content by reducing power levels as a means of protecting the engine. On standard
            low-octane fuels, power is reduced to <b>960 PS (706 kW; 947 hp)</b>.
          </p>
          <p>The Agera R was featured prominently in the Need for Speed franchise, prominently in Criterion Games' <a
              href="">Need
              for Speed: Most Wanted (2012)</a> and <a href="">Ghost Games' Need for Speed Rivals (2013)</a>. Replicas
            of the Agera R were
            featured in the 2014 film Need for Speed. It is also featured in <a href="">the 2013 mobile game Real Racing
              3</a>, <a href="">Nitro
              Nation Drag & Drift (2014)</a> and <a href="">CSR Racing(2012)</a></p>

          </div>
          <p>Koenigsegg presented <b>the Agera S model in 2013</b>. Built for markets <b>lacking E85 biofuel</b>, the
            Agera S has most
            of the upgrades of the Agera R compared to the normal Agera including the dynamic wing, but is optimised for
            running on low-octane petrol generating a maximum power output of <b>1,030 PS (758 kW; 1,016 hp)</b> and
            <b>1,100 N⋅m
              (811 lbf⋅ft)</b> of torque compared to <b>the 960 PS (706 kW; 947 hp)</b> and <b>1,100 N⋅m (811
              lbf⋅ft)</b> of torque of an
            Agera R running on the same fuel. In 2013, one Agera S was the 100th Koenigsegg ever produced,
            celebrated by a specially-built car with gold leaf inlays named <b>"Hundra" (Swedish for "one hundred")</b>.
          </p>
          <p>On 10 June 2014, <a href="">NAZA Swedish Motors</a> launched the Agera S in <b>Malaysia</b>. It was the
            second Koenigsegg after
            the CCXR to arrive in the country, thus setting a new market for Koenigsegg. It was priced at <b>RM
              5,000,000</b>
            before taxes and it was estimated that it will be priced at <b>RM 15,000,000</b> with government tax and
            duties—making it one of the most expensive cars in the country. The Agera S is the only model offered in
            Malaysia due to the absence of E85 biofuel there.</p>

          <p><b>The Koenigsegg One:1</b> was presented at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show held in March. Koenigsegg built
            six cars apart from the car presented at <b>the Geneva Motor Show</b>, all of which were already sold.
            Koenigsegg
            took two cars to the 2014 Goodwood Festival of Speed, where they were displayed alongside other sports cars
            such as <a href="">the McLaren P1</a>, <a href="">LaFerrari</a>,<a href=""> the Porsche 918 Spyder</a> and
            <a href="">the Pagani Huayra</a>.
          </p>
          <p>The car is fitted with a variant of the same 5.0 L twin-turbocharged V8 engine used in the other Agera
            variants. It generates a maximum power output of <b>1,360 PS (1,000 kW; 1,341 hp)</b> at <b>7,500 rpm</b>
            and <b>1,371 N⋅m
              (1,011 lb⋅ft)</b> of <b>torque at 6,000 rpm</b>. The transmission is a 7-speed dual clutch paddle shift as
            used in
            other variants of the Agera.</p>
          <p>The name One:1 comes from the power-to-weight ratio <b>(1,360 PS to 1360 kg)</b> giving the car 1 PS per 1
            kg
            mass. <b>The 1,360 PS power</b> output is <b>the equivalent of one megawatt</b>, which Koenigsegg claims
            make the One:1
            the 'world's first megacar'. The car is track-focused as opposed to the previous cars made by Koenigsegg,
            leading to changes such as limited boot space.</p>

          <p>The Agera RS was unveiled at <a href="">the 2015 Geneva Motor Show</a>, along with the prototype version of
            the Regera.
            The Agera RS is an advanced version of the Agera R, implementing some of the new technology and features of
            <b>the One:1</b> and combining the features of the Agera R and the Agera S. </b>Koenigsegg</b> billed it as
            "the
            ultimate track tool" due to its lightweight features and track optimised technologies. The Agera RS produces
            450 kg of downforce at 250 km/h. The 5.0-litre V8 engine now has a power output of 1,176 PS (865 kW; 1,160
            hp) on regular pump gasoline. The optional 1-megawatt package increases the engine's power to 1,360 PS
            (1,000 kW; 1,341 hp). 27 units of the Agera RS were built. The model was initially going to be limited to 25
            units, however two extra cars were built, one being the factory development car and one as a replacement for
            a customer car damaged while it was being used for shakedown testing (Agera RS Phoenix built after the crash
            of Agera RS Gryphon). Each Agera RS could be fully customised by its owner.
          </p>
          <p>The Agera RS has the following fuel economy: *21 L/100 km (11 mpg‑US) in the city and 13 L/100 km (18
            mpg‑US) on the highway – which averages to 18 L/100 km (13 mpg‑US).</p>
          <p>The last Agera RS rolled off the production line on 4 April 2018</p>

          </div>
          <p>At <a href="">the 2016 Geneva Motor Show</a>, a final three-car series of the Agera was announced as a
            final celebration
            of the Agera range and as the last models to wear the Agera badge. The cars could be fully customised and
            combined with <b>the Agera RS chassis with the One:1 engine</b>. The first car to be unveiled was called the
            'One
            of One'. It featured a unique orange paint scheme with bare carbon and blue accents. The exterior of the car
            was complemented with a large adjustable rear wing similar to the One:1 and triple front canards along with
            a large front splitter.</p>
          <p>The other two distinct final edition cars were unveiled online in July 2018 and were called <a
              href="">'Agera FE Thor'</a>
            and <a href="">'Agera FE Väder'</a> respectively. Thor features a custom two-tone black paintwork consisting
            of crushed
            diamonds and white accents. The exterior features a large rear wing reminiscent of that found on the Agera
            XS, and a different set of front canards, along with a large front splitter and a Le Mans-style central fin
            for improved downforce, setting it apart from the rest of the Agera models. Väder features the same crushed
            diamond paintwork with a bare carbon fibre centre along with white accents, incorporating the same rear wing
            as Thor but excludes the central fin. Both cars made their public appearance at <b>the 2018 Goodwood
              Festival
              of Speed</b>.</p>
